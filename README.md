# Mortgage Calculator

A simple mortgage calculator built with **React JS** and **Vanilla CSS**. This project was created as part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## Features

- **React Hooks**: Utilized `useState` for state management.
- **Props**: State is forwarded to child components through props.
- **Mortgage Calculation**: The mortgage is calculated using a custom function, and the output is formatted using the browser's **Intl NumberFormat** API.
- **Form Error Handling**: Errors in the form are handled to ensure valid inputs before calculation.

## Challenges

The most challenging aspect of the project was:
- Creating the mortgage calculation function.
- Formatting the result in a user-friendly manner using the browser's formatting API.
- Managing and passing state between components effectively.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:
- React fundamentals such as state management and the use of props.
- Error handling in forms to manage invalid user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**
- **Vanilla CSS**
